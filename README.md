# TicTacToe 

# Description

Our project is about the popular game of TicTacToe and making it able to be played over a network. For our project, we used socket programming to communicate over the network, and Java and Java Swing to create a GUI and a client-server architecture. 

# Getting Started

# Install

In order to install our project, you must have Eclipse 2019 and the most recent JDK downloaded. If you fork the repository and download the zip file, you can import it into Eclipse.

If you would like to play a game against yourself you must download the JAR file attached into the repo and save it to your Desktop.

# Run

If playing against other people:

1. Change line 28 to be: "private String ip = "insert your IP addess here";"
2. Save and press the run button in the top left corner in eclipse.
3. Enter your IP address and port number or "12345".
4. Once the other player logs on with your IP and same port number, the game will start.

If playing against yourself:

1. Open two command prompts.
2. Type "java - jar " and then drag the JAR file that was saved to your desktop from your Desktop to the command prompt. Do this for both windows.
3. Enter "localhost" for the IP address.
4. Enter "12345" for the port number.
